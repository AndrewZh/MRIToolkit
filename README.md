 # MRIToolkit
 ## What is it?
 For my [my research](https://www.isi.uu.nl/people/alberto-de-luca/) I developed a set of scripts and tools to process (diffusion) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, that are (slowly) being integrated in MRIToolkit in a MATLAB (R) toolbox .

## Where do I find it?
[Here](https://github.com/delucaal/MRIToolkit) on Github!

## What can I do with it?
The toolbox is slowly but steadly growing!
###### Ready to use:
[x] LesionEditor: a graphical user interface to visualize and edit segmentations of 3D MRI images, originally designed for delination of multiple-sclerosis lesions on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images 
###### Being integrated and coming soon:
- [ ] 'NiftiIO_basic': Basic Nifti input/output
- [ ] 'ImageRegistrations': Image registration utils based on Elastix
- [ ] 'DW_basic': Basic data structures / utilities for diffusion MRI data
- [ ] 'Diffusion_basic': Class for (basic) dMRI quantification
- [ ] 'DW_IVIMDTDK_I': Diffusion MRI fit utilities - IVIM, DT, DKI 
- [ ] 'Dicom_utils': Tools for handling unconventional or buggy DICOMs
- [ ] 'DW_Laplacian_NNLS': Tools for spectral multi-compartment fit (NNLS/L2NNLS/PL2NNLS)
- [ ] 'MixedCodeUtils': 'Useful general purpose functions
- [ ] 'ThirdParty': Utilities from third parties used in other scripts
- [ ] 'MRIfoundation': Classes for MRI sequences abstraction
- [ ] 'OptimizationMethods': Classes for numeric optimization methods
- [ ] 'Relaxometry': Classes for T1/T2 quantification using inversion-recovery / multi-echo data
- [ ] 'EPG_simulator': Classes for EPG simulations

###### Not yet planned for release:
- 'dfMRI','Diffusion fMRI utilities
